# Location Services Controller

![Application Preview](http://i.imgur.com/FYJ1Pkq.png)

## What does this do?
The iOS Development tools allow a custom location to be set for Location Services debugging. However, a GPX file is required. This package assists with creating a GPX file from Google Maps and updating it in Xcode.

Once setup, all the user must do is search for a location and double click to update.

## Setup
1. Download the binary from the releases page on GitHub. Alternatively, the project can be cloned and ran with `npm install && npm start` if node.js is installed.
2. Open the application. It should start generating a file called `LocationServicesController.gpx` in the same folder the application was started in.
3. The app will need permission to send commands to Xcode. It should ask when it first starts. If it does not, open up `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility` and add the app.
4. Create and compile an empty OS X project in Xcode. A single view application is fine.
5. Go to `Debug -> Simulate Location -> Add GPX file to project...` and select the `LocationServicesController.gpx` file generated by the app.
6. Run the application on Xcode to a targeted iOS Device. Go to the maps application on your connected iOS device to watch your location live update as you double click on the map.
7. Profit!

## Known Issues
1. Intermittently, Xcode may not have `Debug -> Simulate Location -> LocationServicesController` exposed to AppleScript. Manually pressing this item from the Debug menu bar in Xcode should resolve this issue.
2. Updating your location in Xcode will not work when the application is fullscreened.
